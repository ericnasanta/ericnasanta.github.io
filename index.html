      <strong>Issues with the current design</strong>
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Sleek design removes the separation between each of the buttons</li>
      <li>
        No elevation on buttons gives the user no indication of the different
        buttons
      </li>
      <li>No support for disabled users, no braille or elevated letters</li>
      <li>
        Interface has no backlighting so buttons are hard to see in poor
        lighting
      </li>
      <li>
        Buttons and user guide to the buttons within the microwave are unclear
      </li>
      <li>
        Control lock isn’t an essential function, and it uses the same button as
        reset
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="most-common-and-rarer-uses-of-a-microwave">
      <strong>Most common and rarer uses of a microwave</strong>
    </h3>
    <p>
      The most common uses of a microwave are to heat up and defrost food. The
      buttons used for these processes are the 0-9 numbered buttons for cook
      time, and the defrost button. Other common uses are to heat up specific
      foods and beverages such as pizza, popcorn, etc. I mainly use the numbered
      buttons to add cook time, and I use the add 30 seconds button in case I
      misestimate my food’s cook time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The buttons I rarely use on my microwave are the reheat, soften/melt, or
      cook time and power buttons. I also never use the timer functionality on
      my microwave since I never really have a use for it. I never use the
      buttons to cook or defrost by the food's weight.
    </p>
    <h3 id="most-common-sequence-of-actions">
      <strong>Most common sequence of actions</strong>
    </h3>
    <p>This is the most common sequence of actions for using a microwave:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Open the microwave using the large door handle</li>
      <li>Place food in the center of the microwave</li>
      <li>Close the microwave door</li>
      <li>
        Click the numbered buttons to add cook time or press the add 30 seconds
        button.
      </li>
      <li>Press the start button to begin cook timer</li>
      <li>
        The user can wait for the timer to reach zero to open the microwave
        door, or they can open the door prematurely if they believe cooking time
        is over.
      </li>
    </ol>

      <strong
        >How does the microwave help the user understand functionality</strong
      >
    </h3>
    <p>
      The microwave has one word text to signify shortcuts for the user, like
      popcorn, potato, and pizza. The microwave also includes two icons instead
      of text to mark their use with the light and fan buttons. The microwave
      also has a large handle instead of an open door button to help with user
      intuition. The inside of the microwave also shows a short guide for what
      buttons should be used for different kinds and amounts of food.
    </p>
    <h3 id="how-does-the-microwave-provide-feedback-to-the-user">
      <strong>How does the microwave provide feedback to the user</strong>
    </h3>
    <p>
      The microwave signals to the user when the cooking time is over by playing
      a notification sound. The microwave also lights up when it is cooking to
      show the user its current stage of being heated.

        >What are some common mistakes you make with this current design</strong
      >
    </h3>
    <p>
      The current design does not have any features that support disabled
      individuals. There are no indicators to show the separation of each
      button, so users might misclick easier. The buttons also do not have any
      sort of backlight so users must have the lights on to use it. The button
      ‘Cook’ on the microwave is very vague as there are already buttons for
      cook time and starting the microwave. Users might misuse the cook, reheat,
      defrost and soften/melt buttons since they are vague without looking at
      the cooking guide within. Another common mistake would be to also put
      things that are not microwave-safe inside of the microwave, although that
      might be a design error for those objects.
