### **Design of my home microwave**



### **Issues with the current design**
- Sleek design removes the separation between each of the buttons
- No elevation on buttons gives the user no indication of the different buttons
- No support for disabled users, no braille or elevated letters
- Interface has no backlighting so buttons are hard to see in poor lighting
- Buttons and user guide to the buttons within the microwave are unclear
- Control lock isn’t an essential function, and it uses the same button as reset


### **Most common and rarer uses of a microwave**

The most common uses of a microwave are to heat up and defrost food. The buttons used for these processes are the 0-9 numbered buttons for cook time, and the defrost button. Other common uses are to heat up specific foods and beverages such as pizza, popcorn, etc. I mainly use the numbered buttons to add cook time, and I use the add 30 seconds button in case I misestimate my food’s cook time. 

The buttons I rarely use on my microwave are the reheat, soften/melt, or cook time and power buttons. I also never use the timer functionality on my microwave since I never really have a use for it. I never use the buttons to cook or defrost by the food's weight.

### **Most common sequence of actions**

This is the most common sequence of actions for using a microwave:

1. Open the microwave using the large door handle
2. Place food in the center of the microwave
3. Close the microwave door
4. Click the numbered buttons to add cook time or press the add 30 seconds button. 
5. Press the start button to begin cook timer
6. The user can wait for the timer to reach zero to open the microwave door, or they can open the door prematurely if they believe cooking time is over.


### **How does the microwave help the user understand functionality**

The microwave has one word text to signify shortcuts for the user, like popcorn, potato, and pizza. The microwave also includes two icons instead of text to mark their use with the light and fan buttons. The microwave also has a large handle instead of an open door button to help with user intuition. The inside of the microwave also shows a short guide for what buttons should be used for different kinds and amounts of food. 

### **How does the microwave provide feedback to the user**

The microwave signals to the user when the cooking time is over by playing a notification sound. The microwave also lights up when it is cooking to show the user its current stage of being heated.

### **What are some common mistakes you make with this current design**

The current design does not have any features that support disabled individuals. There are no indicators to show the separation of each button, so users might misclick easier. The buttons also do not have any sort of backlight so users must have the lights on to use it. The button ‘Cook’ on the microwave is very vague as there are already buttons for cook time and starting the microwave. Users might misuse the cook, reheat, defrost and soften/melt buttons since they are vague without looking at the cooking guide within. Another common mistake would be to also put things that are not microwave-safe inside of the microwave, although that might be a design error for those objects.
